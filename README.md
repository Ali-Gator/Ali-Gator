I fall in love with the front-end when, as a customer, I encountered difficulties in understanding business tasks by performers and their formal approach to development. I like to create clean code and see the result.

I follow the news from the world of Frontend, listen to podcasts, read articles and educational literature. Participated in the final of the Digital Hackathon 2019 in Kazan.

I love to travel, visited 15 countries.

Skills: HTML / CSS / BEM / JavaScript / JSON / React.js / Git / Webpack / Figma
